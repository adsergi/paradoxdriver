INTRODUCTION

These files are a demonstration of PAL programming techniques using
multi-table forms.  Multi-table forms are easy to design using
interactive Paradox.  However, when you try to incorporate them into
a PAL application, the programming can be very complex.
   I have attempted in this package to address many common
multi-table form functional requirements, and illustrate how to
implement those functions in PAL.

   This material is excerpted from the "Advanced PAL" class which is
part of my Paradox/PAL training series.  This series is conducted on
a regular basis in Southern California.  If you would like more

   These programs were also presented (with a different presentation
document) at the International Paradox Users Conference on May 1,
1990.
   I hope you find this package informative!

DIRECTORY CONTENTS:

   90 files:

        - This "ReadMe" file

        - Multitab.Doc, presentation materials explaining
                        the sample programs

        - 9 script files:
                Common.SC       Form3.SC        Form5.SC   
                Compile.SC      Form3i.SC       Main.SC    
                Form2.SC        Form4.SC        Start.SC   

        - 10 Paradox tables and their families (79 files in all):
                Amount.*        Krental.*       Store.*
                Customer.*      Payment.*       Taxrate.*
                Employee.*      Rental.*        Vidorder.*
                Films.*


HOW TO PRINT THE PRESENTATION MATERIAL:

The presentation material is contained in the file MULTITAB.DOC.
It is a 45-page document illustrating the key features of the
sample programs.  You can print it on your printer with from the
DOS prompt with the command:

        COPY MULTITAB.DOC PRN

However, it will probably look pretty ugly.
   The document is meant to be printed in a mixture of 10-pitch and
compressed type, using a font supporting the IBM graphic character
set.  If you have a Hewlett Packard LaserJet II, that will do the
job.
   Before you print the document, edit it and replace all occurrences
of the following three phrases with control codes for your printer:

        <INITIAL SETUP>      
        
                Replace this line with the control codes
                to initialize your printer, if any.  On the
                HP LaserJet II, I use the following:

                <esc>E
                <esc>(10U<esc>(s10H<esc>&l6D<esc>&a12L
                <esc>&l6E<esc>&a0R

        <BEGIN COMPRESS>

                Replace all occurrences of this line with a
                line to switch to 8-line per inch compressed
                type.  On the HP LaserJet II, I use the following:

                <esc>(10U<esc>(s16.66H<esc>&l8D<esc>&a27L

        <END COMPRESS>

                Replace all occurrences of this line with a
                line to switch to 6-line per inch 10-pitch
                type.  On the HP LaserJet II, I use the following:

                <esc>(10U<esc>(s10H<esc>&l6D<esc>&a12L



CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS:

1.  Paradox version 3.01a.

2.  Set the "Blanks=Zero" setting in the Custom Configuration Program
    (the "custom script") to "Yes."

3.  640K of RAM.


GETTING STARTED:

1.  Create a subdirectory and copy all the files into it.

2.  Start up Paradox in the subdirectory.

3.  Play the script called "Compile."
    This creates the procedure library, MTDEMO.LIB.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

1.  Play the script called "Start."

2.  The main menu will appear:

        2   3   3-I   4   5/6   Quit

3.  Each menu choice (except "Quit") performs a different data
    entry program.  All the programs illustrate multi-table form
    PAL programming techniques.  All of the forms resemble one
    another, but each program illustrates a different set of
    techniques:

    2:    Basic Video Store Rental Entry (form Vidorder.F2)
    3:    Automatic Assignment of Line Numbers (form Vidorder.F3)
    3-I:  Automatic Assignment of Line Numbers, with the ability
             to Insert New Lines Between Two Others (form Vidorder.F3)
    4:    Unlinked Forms for Films & Tax Rates (form Vidorder.F4)
    5/6:  Two Forms Using Shadow Table Technique (form Vidorder.F5&6)

4.  Select any menu choice.  As the forms appear, fill them out in
    the normal manner.  The top two lines of the screen will tell you
    what function keys to press.

5.  After you exit back to Paradox, you can press the [Ctrl-F10]
    key to start up the application.  This is the same as playing
    the "Start" script again.
